    abstract  = {In this dissertation, we have proposed novel methods for robust parsing that integrate the flexibility of linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques. Our thesis is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context. However, increasing the complexity of descriptions makes the number of different descriptions for each lexical item much larger and hence increases the local ambiguity for a parser. This local ambiguity can be resolved by using supertag cooccurrence statistics collected from parsed corpora. We have explored these ideas in the context of Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) framework wherein supertag disambiguation provides a representation that is an almost parse. We have used the disambiguated supertag sequence in conjunction with a lightweight dependency analyzer to compute noun groups, verb groups, dependency linkages and even partial parses. We have shown that a trigram-based supertagger achieves an accuracy of 92.1\% on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) texts. Furthermore, we have shown that the lightweight dependency analysis on the output of the supertagger identifies 83\% of the dependency links accurately. We have exploited the representation of supertags with Explanation-Based Learning to improve parsing efficiency. In this approach, parsing in limited domains can be modeled as a Finite-State Transduction. We have implemented such a system for the ATIS domain which improves parsing efficiency by a factor of 15. We have used the supertagger in a variety of applications to provide lexical descriptions at an appropriate granularity. In an information retrieval application, we show that the supertag based system performs at higher levels of precision compared to a system based on part-of-speech tags. In an information extraction task, supertags are used in specifying extraction patterns. For language modeling applications, we view supertags as syntactically motivated class labels in a class-based language model. The distinction between recursive and non-recursive supertags is exploited in a sentence simplification application.},

    abstract  = {Language pairs such as Chinese and English with largely differing word order have proved to be one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation. One reason is that such techniques usually work with sentences as flat strings of words, rather than explicitly attempting to parse any sort of hierarchical structural representation. Because even simple syntactic differences between languages can quickly lead to a universe of idiosyncratic surface-level word reordering rules, many believe the near future of machine translation will lie heavily in syntactic modeling. The time to start may be now: advances in statistical parsing over the last decade have already started opening the door. Following the work of Cowan et al., I present a statistical tree-to-tree translation system for Chinese to English that formulates the translation step as a prediction of English clause structure from Chinese clause structure. Chinese sentences are segmented and parsed, split into clauses, and independently translated into English clauses using a discriminative feature-based model. Clausal arguments, such as subject and object, are translated separately using an off-the-shelf phrase-based translator. By explicitly modeling syntax at a clausal level, but using a phrase-based (flat-sentence) method on local, reduced expressions, such as clausal arguments, I aim to address the current weakness in long-distance word reordering while still leveraging the excellent local translations that today's state of the art has to offer.},

    abstract  = {The research presented here focuses on modeling machine-learning performance. The thesis introduces Seer, a system that generates empirical observations of classification-learning performance and then uses those observations to create statistical models. The models can be used to predict the number of training examples needed to achieve a desired level and the maximum accuracy possible given an unlimited number of training examples. Seer advances the state of the art with 1) models that embody the best constraints for classification learning and most useful parameters, 2) algorithms that efficiently find maximum-likelihood models, and 3) a demonstration on real-world data from three domains of a practicable application of such modeling. The first part of the thesis gives an overview of the requirements for a good maximum-likelihood model of classification-learning performance. Next, reasonable design choices for such models are explored. Selection among such models is a task of nonlinear programming, but by exploiting appropriate problem constraints, the task is reduced to a nonlinear regression task that can be solved with an efficient iterative algorithm. The latter part of the thesis describes almost 100 experiments in the domains of soybean disease, heart disease, and audiological problems. The tests show that Seer is excellent at characterizing learning-performance and that it seems to be as good as possible at predicting learning performance. Finally, recommendations for choosing a regression model for a particular situation are made and directions for further research are identified.},

    abstract  = {Machine translation (MT) systems are renowned for making many translation errors. Spotting such errors can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive process which makes automatic evaluation and correction of MT output highly desirable for both system developers and end-users. Based on the novel approach of using statistical language models to assess the quality of MT, the main aim of this project is to automatically spot sentences containing translation errors in the output of a commercial MT system by means of N-gram models built from a target language corpus. This method, which is presented in this MSc dissertation, aims to differentiate between good- and bad-quality translations of sentences in terms of the cross entropy scores produced by the language model. The cross entropy values assigned to a set of known good quality human-written sentences translations will be used as a reference point in the pilot experiment. Issues such as sentence length and the occurrence of unseen events in the test data will be addressed and the behaviour of various language modeling parameters, including the N-gram order, the smoothing technique, the amount of training data and the vocabulary size, will be investigated.}
