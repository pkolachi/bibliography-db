  abstract  = {In semantic parsing, natural language questions map to expressions in a meaning
	representation language (MRL) over some fixed vocabulary of predicates. To do
	this reliably, one must guarantee that for a wide class of natural language
	questions (the so called semantically tractable questions), correct
	interpretations are always in the mapped set of possibilities. In this
	demonstration, we introduce the system COVER which significantly clarifies,
	revises and extends the basic notion of semantic tractability. COVER achieves
	coverage of 89% while the earlier PRECISE system achieved coverage of 77% on
	the well known GeoQuery corpus. Like PRECISE, COVER requires only a simple
	domain lexicon and integrates off-the-shelf syntactic parsers. Beyond PRECISE,
	COVER also integrates off-the-shelf theorem provers to provide more accurate
	results. COVER is written in Python and uses the NLTK.},
