	 To improve the parsability of UD, we propose a back-and-forth conversion
	algorithm, in which we preprocess the training treebank to increase
	parsability, and reconvert the parser outputs to follow the UD scheme as a
	postprocess.
	 We show that this technique consistently improves LAS across languages even
	with a state-of-the-art parser, in particular on core dependency arcs such as
	nominal modifier.
	 We also provide an in-depth analysis to understand why our method increases

	Experiments with several language pairs on word similarity and bilingual
	lexicon induction, two fundamental semantic tasks emphasising semantic
	similarity, suggest the usefulness of the proposed syntactically informed
	cross-lingual word vector spaces. Improvements are observed in both tasks over
