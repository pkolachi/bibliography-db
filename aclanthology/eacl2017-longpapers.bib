  abstract  = {Machine reading using differentiable reasoning models has recently shown
	remarkable progress. In this context, End-to-End trainable Memory Networks
	(MemN2N) have demonstrated promising performance on simple natural language
	based reasoning tasks such as factual reasoning and basic deduction. However,
	other tasks, namely multi-fact question-answering, positional reasoning or
	dialog related tasks, remain challenging particularly due to the necessity of
	more complex interactions between the memory and controller modules composing
	this family of models. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end memory
	access regulation mechanism inspired by the current progress on the connection
	short-cutting principle in the field of computer vision. Concretely, we develop
	a Gated End-to-End trainable Memory Network architecture (GMemN2N). From the
	machine learning perspective, this new capability is learned in an end-to-end
	fashion without the use of any additional supervision signal which is, as far
	as our knowledge goes, the first of its kind. Our experiments show significant
	improvements on the most challenging tasks in the 20 bAbI dataset, without the
	use of any domain knowledge. Then, we show improvements on the Dialog bAbI
	tasks including the real human-bot conversion-based Dialog State Tracking
	Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. On these two datasets, our model sets the new state
	of the art.},

  abstract  = {Building knowledge bases (KB) automatically from text corpora is crucial for
	many applications such as question answering and web search. The problem is
	very challenging and has been divided into sub-problems such as mention and
	named entity recognition, entity linking and relation extraction. However,
	combining these components has shown to be under-constrained and often produces
	KBs with supersize entities and common-sense errors in relations (a person has
	multiple birthdates). The errors are difficult to resolve solely with IE tools
	but become obvious with world knowledge at the corpus level. By analyzing
	Freebase and a large text collection, we found that per-relation cardinality
	and the popularity of entities follow the power-law distribution favoring flat
	long tails with low-frequency instances. We present a probabilistic joint
	inference algorithm to incorporate this world knowledge during KB construction.
	Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the TAC Cold Start task,
	and 42% and 19.4% relative improvements in F1 over our baseline on Cold Start
	hop-1 and all-hop queries respectively.},

	base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types---not
	only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia
	infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text.  
	This prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one
	type per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity
	types or binary relation types, respectively).                                       
	     
	Factorizing this sparsely observed matrix yields a learned vector embedding for
	each row and each column.  
	In this paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or
	entity-pairs unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row
	embedding).  
	We propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a
	row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of
	the observed columns for that row.  
	We experiment with various aggregation functions, including neural network
	attention models.  
	Our approach can be understood as a natural language database, in that
	questions about KB entities are answered by attending to textual or database
	evidence.  
	In experiments predicting both relations and entity types, we demonstrate that
	despite having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than traditional
	universal schema, we can match the accuracy of the traditional model, and more
	importantly, we can now make predictions about unseen rows with nearly the same
	accuracy as rows available at training time.},

  abstract  = {To extract structured representations of newsworthy events from Twitter,
	unsupervised models typically assume that tweets involving the same named
	entities and expressed using similar words are likely to belong to the same
	event. Hence, they group tweets into clusters based on the co-occurrence
	patterns of named entities and topical keywords. However, there are two main
	limitations. First, they require the number of events to be known beforehand,
	which is not realistic in practical applications. Second, they don't recognise
	that the same named entity might be referred to by multiple mentions and tweets
	using different mentions would be wrongly assigned to different events. To
	overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model
	with word embeddings for event extraction, in which the number of events can be
	inferred automatically and the issue of lexical variations for the same named
	entity can be dealt with properly. Our model has been evaluated on three
	datasets with sizes ranging between 2,499 and over 60 million tweets.

	Identity is often reflected in language use, suggesting the intuitive

	to use distinctively Scottish words than those who oppose it. In the first
	large-scale study of sociolinguistic variation on social media in the UK, we
	identify distinctively Scottish terms in a data-driven way, and find that these
	terms are indeed used at a higher rate by users of pro-independence hashtags
	than by users of anti-independence hashtags.  However, we also find that in
	general people are less likely to use distinctively Scottish words in tweets
	with referendum-related hashtags than in their general Twitter activity. We
	attribute this difference to style shifting relative to audience, aligning with
	previous work showing that Twitter users tend to use fewer local variants when

	find that headedness plays a central role in phrasal representation (with the
	model's latent attention largely agreeing with predictions made by hand-crafted
	head rules, albeit with some important differences). By training grammars
	without nonterminal labels, we find that phrasal representations depend
	minimally on nonterminals, providing support for the endocentricity hypothesis.},

	Despite being a natural comparison and addition, previous work on attentive
	neural architectures have not considered hand-crafted features and we combine
	these with learnt features and establish that they complement each other. 
	Additionally, through quantitative analysis we establish that the attention
	mechanism learns to attend over syntactic heads and the phrase containing the
	mention, both of which are known to be strong hand-crafted features for our
	task.  We introduce parameter sharing between labels through a hierarchical
	encoding method, that in low-dimensional projections show clear clusters for
	each type hierarchy.  Lastly, despite using the same evaluation dataset, the
	literature frequently compare models trained using different data.  We
	demonstrate that the choice of training data has a drastic impact on
	performance, which decreases by as much as 9.85% loose micro F1 score for a
	previously proposed method.  Despite this discrepancy, our best model achieves
	state-of-the-art results with 75.36% loose micro F1 score on the
	well-established Figer (GOLD) dataset and we report the best results for models
	trained using publicly available data for the OntoNotes dataset with 64.93%
