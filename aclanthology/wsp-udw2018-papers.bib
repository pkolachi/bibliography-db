                 Universal Dependencies format -- PDBUD -- with 22K trees and 
		 352K tokens. PDBUD builds on its previous version, i.e. the 
		 Polish UD treebank (PL-SZ), and contains all 8K PL-SZ trees. The 
		 PL-SZ trees are checked and possibly corrected in the current 
		 edition of PDBUD. Further 14K trees are automatically converted 
		 from a new version of Polish Dependency Bank. The PDBUD trees 
		 are expanded with the enhanced edges encoding the shared 
		 dependents and the shared governors of the coordinated conjuncts 
		 and with the semantic roles of some dependents. The conducted 
		 evaluation experiments show that PDBUD is large enough for 
		 training a high-quality graph-based dependency parser for Polish."

                 to approximate dynamic oracles for transition systems where 
		 exact dynamic oracles are difficult to derive. We treat oracle 
		 parsing as a reinforcement learning problem, design the reward 
		 function inspired by the classical dynamic oracle, and use 
		 Deep Q-Learning (DQN) techniques to train the oracle with gold 
		 trees as features. The combination of a priori knowledge and 
		 data-driven methods enables an efficient dynamic oracle, which 
		 improves the parser performance over static oracles in several 
		 transition systems."
