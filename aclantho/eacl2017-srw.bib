  abstract  = {Spelling variation in non-standard language, e.g. computer-mediated
	communication and historical texts, is usually treated as a deviation from a
	standard spelling, e.g. 2mr as an non-standard spelling for tomorrow.
	Consequently, in normalization -- the standard approach of dealing with
	spelling variation -- so-called non-standard words are mapped to their
	corresponding standard words. However, there is not always a corresponding
	standard word. This can be the case for single types (like emoticons in
	computer-mediated communication) or a complete language, e.g. texts from
	historical languages that did not develop to a standard variety. The approach
	presented in this
	thesis proposal deals with spelling variation in absence of reference to a
	standard. The task is to detect pairs of types that are variants of the same
	morphological word. An approach for spelling-variant detection is presented,
	where pairs of potential spelling variants are generated with Levenshtein
	distance and subsequently filtered by supervised machine learning. The
	approach is evaluated on historical Low German texts. Finally, further
	perspectives are discussed.},

	real-life sets of numerical data satisfy.
	In particular, we study the similarity of frequency distribution of hashtag
	popularity with respect to Zipf’s law, an empirical law referring to the
	phenomenon that many types of data in social sciences can be approximated with
	a Zipfian distribution.
	Additionally, we also analyse  Benford’s law, is a special case of Zipf's
	law, a common pattern about the frequency distribution of leading digits. In
	order to compute correctly the frequency distribution of hashtag popularity, we
	need to correct many spelling errors that Twitter's users introduce. For this
	purpose we introduce a new filter to correct hashtag mistake based on string
	distances. The experiments obtained employing datasets of Twitter streams
